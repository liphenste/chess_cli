<h1>chess_cli</h1>

The goal of this project is to write a lightweight command-line based chess interface that is easy to use.

An option will be given to toggle a visual display, so the player can choose whether to play "blindfolded" or traditional.

<h3>Motivations</h3>

- Application of current CS knowledge towards an interesting project
- Programming an interface that motivates my own chess learning (i.e. by use of blindfold)
